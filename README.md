About me:

East coast transplant in the Bay Area. I'm an artist, an avid reader, and I'm curious as heck. I want to know as much as possible about this strange world.

Goals for the course: 

I want to be comfortable with Python and I want to learn about programming in general.

My first Python program:

message = 'sup fam'
print(message)
